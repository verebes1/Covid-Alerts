- Time permitting update the README.md to include information for the next developer who would take over the project.

## Day two:

- Set up networking including the timer for every 10 minutes
- Make a model for the networked data to analyse case amounts
- Connect the received data to the app

- Add the additional state into the JSON file for the app to automatically extend itself by the extra traffic light state.
