# COVID-19 Alerts

## Introduction

The app is built using UIKit. Using pure programmatic approach.

## Structure:

All the components of the app are categorised into separate groups for readability:
- View for the UIView elements.
- Model for the Model elements.
- Controller for the UIViewController elements.
- Networking for the networking components of the app.
- Extensions for any Swift Standard Library extensions.
- Supporting files for the AppDelegate, SceneDelegate and Assets


## What is done:

- The UI layout and the creation of the reusable UI elements
- The traffic-light.json for easy app extensibility.

## What needs doing:
- Networking layer
- The second ViewController which needs to display the details of each covid level
- Add Unit and UITests
